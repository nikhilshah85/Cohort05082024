						Index (for the performance of query)


	They are used to improve server performance to search for records faster
		There are 2 types of indexes
	a. clustered index
	b. Non-clustered index


	clustered index is only 1 per table
	they get created when you create a primary key	 - this is for identity column
	Non-clustered index gets created on other columns - this is for other columns

	with clustered index, data is sorted in the same place/storage
	non-clustered index, all the pages are copied to another place and then they got sorted

	so we created non-clustered index on accType which will fasten up the below query
	select * from accountsInfo where accType='Savings'

	many times queries are based on 2 columns
	select * from accountsInfo where accType='Savings' and accBalance > 5000
	
	this index is also termed as composite index

				Consume REST API Service
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
			     There are 2 approaches


	1. JavaScript - Client side calls
		we use fetch api (method) which is a standard of REST by W3C and ECMA
			This api is built into every tool/technology which understands web
			eg. Browsers, Mobile apps etc..

			This is the fastest way to get the data 
			Less secured, should not be used for scencetive data / clients personal data
			eg. BankAccount,EmpDetails,CreditCardInfo etc...
	can be used for open data to world, like FlightSchedule, CurrencyExchange,stock	Rates
	sports data open to everyone etc..

	2. HttpClient obj - Part of rest
		we use this in programming, C#, Java, python, typescript, angular, MVC etc..
		can be used even for console app, whereas fetch api will not work for console app
			This is very secure, little bit slower than above 1

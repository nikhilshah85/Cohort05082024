						OOPS 

		Object Oriented Programming System/Structure


		Object - Is an Real World entity 

	1.Every object will have a description - like an key and a value - called Properties
		eg. Laptop 
			color = "Black";
			OS = "Windows";
			weight = "3Kgs";
			
	2. Methods / Functions / Actions 

	3. Enums - this are predefined list of values, and other values will not be accepted
		for eg. Gender property in an Employee object
			
		Enum Gender
		{
			Male,Female
		}

		Properies
		public string EmployeeName {get;set}
		public double EmployeeSalary{get;set}
		public Gender EmployeeGender{get;set;}

		Employee empObj = new Employee();
			empObj.EmployeeGender = 


	4. What is a class - class is a blue print of an object 
		class is the place where developers writes login, code, properties, methods, constructors, 			events etc...and then from this class 100's of objects will be created

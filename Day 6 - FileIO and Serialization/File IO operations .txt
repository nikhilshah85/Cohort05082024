		File IO operations 
		using FileStream
		      StreamReader
		      StreamWriter

	they are good for loosely coupled data and primitive data types like int, string, double etc
	
	but is not suitable for Custom Objects

	if you wish to store an Object which has 20 properies, it becomes really lenthy and difficult
	Object are also passed over network on internet, eg. accounts obj at Bank, ATM obj at atm machines	etc...

	they need to be in a Format like XML, SOAP, Binary etc..
	Which FileIO does not do

	Thus we have a new Concept called Serialization

	Serialization is a process to persist state of an Object in memory to a storage or network
		Thus let us have a look at serialization
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	let us first prepare the fundmenatals needed to learn serialization


	1. Create a new project - SerializationDemo
	2. Add a new File - Accounts.cs
	3. Add a new class - Accounts with below properties and methods
		AccNo, AccName, AccType,AccBalance,AccIsActive
		WithDraw(amt) method
		Deposit(amt) method
		CreateNewAccount
		ReadAccount
	4. In program.cs, create a structure using while loop and switch case for below options
		1. Create New Account
		2. Read Account Details
		3. Withdraw
		4. Deposit
		5. Exit

		(similar to what you had in program.cs for previous example)

we need to include
	1.	using System.IO; //on top

	2. 		we will use 1 of the class to point to a file
		FileStream myFile = new FileStream("myfile.txt",FileMode.Create,FileAccess.Write);

	3. 		we will use 1 of the class to read or write
		  StreamWriter wr = new StreamWriter(myFile);
			wr.WriteLine("Hello My Name is Nikhil");
			wr.WriteLine("I am from India");	
			wr.WriteLine("I love Programming");


			if you wish to read 
		 StreamReader rd = new StreamReader(myFile);
		 rd.ReadLine(); //read the first line
		 rd.ReadLine(); //second line
		 rd.ReadLine(); //third line
		 rd.ReadLine(); //fourth line

	4. once you are done with your activities
		you should close the connection to file
			wr.Close();
			or
			rd.Close();
			myFlie.Close();

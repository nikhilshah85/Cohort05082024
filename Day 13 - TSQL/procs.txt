SQL 
	Sublanguages
		DDL
		DML
		DQL
		DTL / DCL - data control language - data transaction language
			commit(save) - confirm the save - control + S
			rollback (undo) - control + Z

TSQL - Transact SQL 
	This gives programming ability to the SQL

	Important objects
		Function
		Procedure
		Trigger
		Exceptions
		Cursor
	This also add a lot in terms of performance and security

	part of DDL
		create 
		alter
		drop


----------------------------------------------------------------------



Functions 
	They are used for 
		Calculations
		Data formatting
		validations


procedure
	They are used for - Data Manipulation and selection
		Select
		Insert
		update
		delete


Triggers
		Types
			After trigger
			Before trigger (this is a custom constraint)
			Instead of trigger (specially invented for views)
	They are used for Automation
		eg
		in below tables
			EmployeeInfo
				when you make anychange in employee, insert, update or del a record
			we want server to mark an entry for us in the backend on its own in EmpHistorytable

		another example - for a grocery store
			below are the tables

			StockInfo
	PId	Product       AvailableQty
	101	Pepsi  		50
	102	Sandwich	50
	103	Toothpaste	50
	104	Razor		50
	105	Apple Juice	50

			SalesTable (when someone buys and pays we make an entry here)
		SaleId	ProductId PurchaseQty ....amt etc..
		1	101	   6
		2	104	   7
		3	105	   12
		4	101	   18
	when a new sale is made, server should update stock info table and reduce the availability value for 	that product


		Further we have a table call Reorder
	when the available qty goes below 15, an enter should be made in Reorder table for that product
		and when it reached 5 - server can send an email to supplier of that product
------------------------------------------

Before trigger
	Nobody - should be able to perform Insert, update, delete on employee table
		During non-working hours and on holidays
		you or HR cannot add a new employee to system on Friday evening

		we want to tell server to check 
		if time falls between 9AM to 5PM AND day is Monday to Friday  then only do DML
			else show an exception message

----------------
Instead of trigger created on views






-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		For Accounts info we created 
		AddNewccount
		DeleteAccount
		UpdateAccount

		We need to search account based on no, type, isactive etc.. multiple parapamets

		developers end up createing 6-7 procedures per table

		now, if we have 20 tables it would end up createing 120 procs
		which server has to take care of !!

		in 1 of the approach you create 1 procedure for all the operations on a table

1. dotnet --version
2. dotnet new console --name helloworld
	   anytype of application you want to create (eg. mvc, WebAPI, winform,wpf,etc...)
3. cd helloworld
4. dotnet build (this will convert English written code to MSIL)
5. dotnet run (show me the output, in the background code goes to CLR and msil gets converted into
			machine language code, remember, machine language for every os is different)

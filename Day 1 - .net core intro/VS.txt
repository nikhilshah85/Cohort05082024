For .net 

Organizations / client had to 

1. Buy windows OS - this is not free - Pay for the licence (why not Linux, ubuntu which are free )
2. Visual studio is an excellent tool - Not free - pay licence (why not eclipse, it is free)
3. Host / deploy application on Windows Server (web) - very costly - (why not on tomcat apache, 	glassfish, node - completly free) 
4. things looks userfriendly,but in real you dont know what is going on in the background
	so you pay Microsoft for support, customer care, tickets etc..

--------
thus u had, Java, Angular, React, Node, Mongo etc... free and with support etc..

this was a loosing business for Microsoft

additionally cloud came up, they had to stand the competition

	Thus now they have open source, free development and hosting with .net core

		free developmet on any OS - .Net core and VS Code (vs code works with commands)

--we will create a new application, build it, run it with cli

function downloadMyFiles()
{
	var something = "....."
	var url = "https://www.microsoft.com/sqlserver/2012/sqlexpress" --200 mb - 120 sec
	var num1  = 20; //if this is to be taken from txtbox - ui will be freezed
	var num2 = 30;
	var result = num1 + num2;
	document.getElementById("result").innerHTML = result;
	
	var videoUrl = "https://www.youtube.com/microsoft/dotnetcore"

	document.getElementById("vdeo").src = videoUrl;

}

---what happens with js or even C#, they are procedure execution (line by line)

--here user will have to wait till the 200mb file gets downloaded

	to solve this problem we have asyn and await (asynchronous programming)

		the code will keep execution, and it users ui does not have to be freezed 
		processing is done in chunk 
 

		make ur methods asyn and use await for the method to complet and capture the result

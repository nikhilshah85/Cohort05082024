if we have 10 controllers and each controller has 5 action methods (50 methods in all)

	we have different clients to whom data has to be given access to 

	1st client can have access only to first 3 controllers
		in that only GET and PUT part
			post and delete not allowed 


	2nd client, can access all the controllers but only get methods, no other methods


	3rd client, can access 4th and 5th controller completely with all the methods


		Thus we create different cors policies in program.cs

------------
1. install cors nuget

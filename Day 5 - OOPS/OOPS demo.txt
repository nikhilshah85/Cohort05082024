1. Create a new Project in Day 5 folder - BankingAPP_OOPS
2. in the project add a new file Accounts.cs and add below properties and methods
	AccountNo, AccountName,AccountBalance,AccountIsActive,AccountBranch

	methods
		WithDraw(amount)
		Deposit(amount)
		CheckBalance

3. Let us add 3 more types of accounts to the solution
	add a new file Savings.cs
		       Checking.cs
		       Loan.cs

		we will create classes within this file

This classes are suppose to have the similar properties and methods as mentioned above for accounts class
we will use inheritance instead of rewiting the properties and methods

4. Let us add 1 property specifically to all this classes to check the object
	
    public int IntrestEarned { get; set; } //savings

   public bool EnableOverDraftFacilty { get; set; }  //checking

    public double RateOfIntrest { get; set; } //loan


5. Polymorphism,  Now for the Withdraw method we wish to have different rules for all 3 classes
		i.e 
		Savings accounts object can withdraw maximum 20000 in a day/transaction
		Checking account object can withdraw maximum 100000 in a day/transaction
					they can even withdraw even if they do not have adequate balance
				provided OverFacility property is true
		Loan account cannot withdraw 

		to achive so, we will mark Withdraw method as
		1. virtual in parent class 
		2. overrides in child class

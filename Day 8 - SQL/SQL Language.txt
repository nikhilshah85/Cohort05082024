					SQL - Structured Query Language

					divided into sublanguages based on operations you do 

				Sublanguages
					A. DDL - Data Defination language
	This is to define a structure to store the data, eg. structure of emp table

					it has below commands
			1-- Create (to create a new object -database, table, view, function, proc etc)
			2-- alter (to modify the structure of object - add more column)
			3-- drop (to drop the object from database) - delete emp table

			Syntax structure
			create objecttype objectName(.......)
			create table EmployeeInfo( columns list)
			create procedure EmpBonus(@salary int, @percentage int){ ..... }
			create database EmployeeManagement 

					B. DML - Data Manipulation Language
			4.--Insert (to add new data to the table, record/row)
			5.--Update (to Edit record)
			6.--Delete (to delete the record)


					C. DQL - Data Query Language
	(emp Is a table with columns empNo, empName,empDesination,empSal,empIsActive)

			7. select * from emp (this will select all the data, all the columns)
			8. select * from emp where empNo = 101
			   select * from emp where empDesignation = 'Manager'
			   select * from emp where empSal > 10000 and empIsActive = 1
			   select * from emp where empName = 'Rick'
			9. select empNo,empName from emp
			10. select empNo, empName, empSal, empSal * 0.2 from emp;
			11. select upper(empName) from emp;
			12. select empName + ' : ' + empDesigantion from emp;

		-----------------------------------------------------
			  How to filter data ? we use where clause
				eg. Point 8 above
			13. How to sort the data ? we use order by clause
				select * from emp order by empName
			14. work with Aggregate functions 
				Sum, Min, Max, Count, Avg

				select min(empSal) from emp
				select max(empSal) from emp
				select count(empNo) from emp
				select sum(empSal) from emp
				select avg(empSal) from emp

			15. I have 3 types of AccType --> Savings, Checking and Loan
			I want to know how many are savings, how many checking and how many loan 

				select count(accType) from AccountsInfo where accType = 'Savings'

				select count(accType) from AccountsInfo where accType = 'Checking'

				select count(accType) from AccountsInfo where accType = 'Loan'

				
--you will need to write seperate query for every accType, if you have 50 types of account
	instead you can use group by and get the data all at once

		select count(accType), accType from accountsInfo 
			group by accType

		Try : 1. fire a query to know total of active and inactive accounts
		      2. Total Available balance for active and inactive acc



		16. How to collect unique values from a column ? eg what are types of account you have
			distinct 
			select distinct accType from accountsInfo

		17. String functions
			upper,lower,concat,substring big list.... 
		18. Wildcard characters % and _
			
			select * from AccountsInfo where accName like 'S%'
			select * from AccountsInfo where accName like '_a%'
			select * from AccountsInfo where accName like '%k'

		19. select with column alias, when you calculate or have functional data as result
			column names are abscent, you may want to name them
			also you do not want to display the default column name as output

SOA based SOAP messages - Web Services were good 
but in today world we have below problems

1. SOAP is very heavy to transport(1kb data, with 5 kb meta data, end user has nothing to do with metadata)
2. SOAP, since it had lot of data, heavy and bulky packets, it use to take more time to 
		serialize and deserialize
3. Web Services were built for web(use to run on web) - but it did not follow web standards(HttpStandards)
4. Web services were tightly coupled application - it used proxy files to keep data and clients for communiation - which indirectly meant it is not open to everyone

-------------------------------------------------		
	Thus a new light weight technology was needed and for the same JSON format was choose
		JSON - java Script object notation - text based light weight language, faster, easy

		REST technology / services were introduced by 
			W3C and ECMA 
			W3C - World Wide Web Consortium
			ECMA - European Computer Manufacturing Association 

		Microsoft Adopted this standards
			created compilers, namespaces, classes, methods, properties etc

		and gave it a name as ASP.Net WebAPI with .net core 

		There is a seperate designation in a team - REST API developer	
			They are suppose to be good at 2 below points
			1. How to create REST services for users, other teams, clients, customers etc..
		  	2. How to consume REST services in console app/ASP.Net MVC/ REACT / Angular etc.

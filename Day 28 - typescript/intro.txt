				C# - with OOPS
				SQL 
				Entity Framework
				REST API
				HTML, CSS and JS



	.Net - Microsoft  - ASP.net Core for front end development - MVC - Model View Controller
				language used -- C# - OOPS based


	React - Facebook - Component Based Development -- all you think and develop here is a component
	Angular - Google - Component Based Development --  all you think and develop here is a component

			language used -- ES6 -- OOPS added to JavaScript
			Ecma Script 6 and 7 -- they added OOPS to JavaScript and named it as ECMAScript

				it is a very difficult language to learn and use for developers coming from 
				C# and Java, C++ background

		Microsoft came forward, made it easy to program ES by making it look like C# and Java
			it applied an wrapper on ES6 and called it as Typescript

		we use typescript for react and angular development, 
		--developer writes syntax in typescript and when you compile, it generates ES

	Bootstrap - twitter 


		

				REACT - this is a front development framework 
		(an ecosystem which allows us to create, build, test and run the application - front end)

					
To use TS, React, Angular we need to download and install Node

what is Node - node is a webserver, compiler, and a development tool which runs on every operating system
	and is considered very super fast, build on V8 engine used by google chrome
		NODE IS BY GOOGLE

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------			Web Applications  - MVC is designed for server centric

	1. Server centric- most of the processing, calculations, validations, formatting, encryption, decryption, etc... state management, caching 
		this is for sensitive applications like banks, insurance, airlines etc.



	component based development is designed for client centric apps
	
	2. Client centric - most of the functionality is done on the client side, download the content on 
			the client app/devise and do the processing, make content available to them
			even when internet is slow or not available (eg. games, whatss app, Instagram, facebook, discord, shopping app amazon)


			react is designed to handle client centric apps - UI based
			angular is a combination of both, client and server centric

	fyi -- in MVC,
		Model  
		View -- u can use react here 
		Controller

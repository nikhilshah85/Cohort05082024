					component communication

				life easy 
		d. make api calls / consume rest api - fetch 
		e. refs, keys etc..

		Data in react
	--we have state as a container which is responsible to hold all the data for the application
	--it will collect data using rest api calls, in background which application starts to load on user devise

	--states will pass the data to childrens using a concept called props
	--data in react flows from top to bottom and not bottom to top

-------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




1. create a new database and add tables to it
	create database P0_nikhil_bankingDB


	below tables
		Admin table
		Customer table
		AccountsInfo
		NewServiceRequest

2.
	a. create a new project - P0_nikhil_bankingAPP
	b. we need to add nuget packages for Entity Framework which will communicate with database
		there are 4 packages which will be installed in sequence
			Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Tools
			Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Design
			Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore
			Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer
	command to add nuget packages 
		dotnet add package ...name of package, eg Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Tools


3. We will download POCO classes from server
	POCO -> Plain C# Objects

	Entity framework is based on design pattern - ORM - object relational mapping
	where in, for everytable in db, you will have a class with that name
			ie 4 classes will be there for Admin,Customer,Accountsinfo,NewServicerequest

			This classes will have properties mapped to columns in that table eg. AccNo

		this is done by using the command on terminal called Scaffold-DbContext

dotnet tool install --global dotnet-ef

dotnet ef dbcontext scaffold "server=NIKHILPC\MUMBAISERVER;database=P0_Nikhil_bankingDB;integrated 		 security=true;TrustServerCertificate=true" Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer -o Models 


---------------
that's it
we use LINQ Queries to talk to database
	LINQ is - Language Integrated query for working with data
		it has similar syntax like sql

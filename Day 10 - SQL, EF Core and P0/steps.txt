I will want to have login creadentials checked from table in a database
I will want to show you the new record creation in a table (insert into table from console)
I want to perform withdraw, deposit and transfer
I want to get the total accounts

-------------
Next week as planned, first half is training
2nd half is project and QC prep 
both on Friday (23rd Aug) 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




1. create a new database and add tables to it
	create database P0_nikhil_bankingDB


	below tables
		Admin table
		Customer table
		AccountsInfo
		NewServiceRequest

2.
	a. create a new project - P0_nikhil_bankingAPP
	b. we need to add nuget packages for Entity Framework which will communicate with database
		there are 4 packages which will be installed in sequence
			Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Tools
			Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Design
			Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore
			Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer
	command to add nuget packages 
		dotnet add package ...name of package, eg Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Tools


3. We will download POCO classes from server
	POCO -> Plain C# Objects

	Entity framework is based on design pattern - ORM - object relational mapping
	where in, for everytable in db, you will have a class with that name
			ie 4 classes will be there for Admin,Customer,Accountsinfo,NewServicerequest

			This classes will have properties mapped to columns in that table eg. AccNo

		this is done by using the command on terminal called Scaffold-DbContext

dotnet tool install --global dotnet-ef

dotnet ef dbcontext scaffold "server=NIKHILPC\MUMBAISERVER;database=P0_Nikhil_bankingDB;integrated 		 security=true;TrustServerCertificate=true" Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer -o Models 


---------------
that's it
we use LINQ Queries to talk to database
	LINQ is - Language Integrated query for working with data
		it has similar syntax like sql





Now, to communicate with database, data, we use LINQ queries

	LINQ - is language Integrated query, this queries you will learn will be similar for any managed/organised data like, collections, filesystem, mailbox, xml files, excel files etc....

		syntax is more like SQL (reverse sql queries and you get linq)

		it starts with var on the left side and query on the right side

		eg. to get all the accounts form database

		var accData = from a in db.accountsInfo
				select a;

			a is like a pointer variable, which could be anything, acc or ab or ac or x or z
			in sql we say select * from accountsInfo
			 we cannot use * in c# because it is an operator for multiplication, and thus we 			use some name there

			db here is an instance of DbContext POCO class


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
			//get all the records	
		var accData = (from a in db.accountsInfo
				      select a).ToList();

		var accData = (from a in db.accountsInfo
				where a.accNo = 103
				select a).Single();

		var isvalidAdmin = (from a in db.adminUser
					where a.userName == 'AdminA' && a.Password == "pass@123"
					select a).single();
				if(isvalidAdmin != null)
				{
					//login successful
				}
				else
				{
					//login failed
				}
		var totalAccounts = (from a in db.accountsInfo
					select a).Count();

			console.writeLine("Enter Account Type");
			string acType = console.readLine();

		var accByType = (from a in db.accountsInfo
				where a.accType == acType
				select a).ToList();

			console.writeLine("Enter Account No");
			int userAcNo =  convert.toint32(console.readLine());


		var accByNo = (from a in db.accountsInfo 
				where a.accNo == userAcNo
				select a).ToSingle()
